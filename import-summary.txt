ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .hgignore
* default.properties
* proguard.cfg
* screenshots/
* screenshots/.DS_Store
* screenshots/scrn1.png
* screenshots/scrn2.png
* screenshots/scrn3.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => devmilColor/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => devmilColor/src/main/res/
* src/ => devmilColor/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => devmilColor/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/de/.DS_Store => devmilColor/src/main/resources/de/.DS_Store
* src/de/devmil/.DS_Store => devmilColor/src/main/resources/de/devmil/.DS_Store
* src/de/devmil/common/.DS_Store => devmilColor/src/main/resources/de/devmil/common/.DS_Store
* src/de/devmil/common/ui/.DS_Store => devmilColor/src/main/resources/de/devmil/common/ui/.DS_Store
* src/de/devmil/common/ui/color/.DS_Store => devmilColor/src/main/resources/de/devmil/common/ui/color/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
